# Usage
You can do almost anything you want with my code. But if you want it plain. 

Change ```<API Key>``` for your API Key and do the same with the other things. If you need help, message me @ UnoriginalLuke#7232 (discord)


```python
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler("<API Key>", "<API Key Secret>") # I removed the OAuthHandler thing, because you can tweet stuff using my bot's account using th9s thing

auth.set_access_token("<Token Key>", '<Token Key Secret>') # This too
```
